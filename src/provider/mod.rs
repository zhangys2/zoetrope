//! Providers: one module per transcript format, each turning its own
//! records into the shared [`Fact`](crate::fact::Fact) vocabulary. Everything
//! a format is *for*, what its records mean and how they join, lives here and
//! nowhere else; the model never learns a field name.
//!
//! # Vocabulary
//!
//! - **Core**: [`fact`](crate::fact), the model, the timeline, the UI. Consumes
//!   facts; knows no format.
//! - **Provider**: one per transcript format, `provider/<name>/`. Speaks the
//!   format and presents one uniform surface to everything else: a per-file
//!   [`Stream`] whose `push(line)` yields a [`Statement`], and a few primitives
//!   about its own files (below).
//! - **Feeder**: one per way of getting bytes. The live tailer (polls files),
//!   the replay assembler (reads files up front), `inspect` (reads and prints),
//!   the browser's append (bytes from JS). Bytes in, a provider's stream in the
//!   middle, statements out to the core. Feeders know where bytes come from and
//!   nothing about what they mean; they reach a provider only through
//!   [`open`], [`sweep`] and [`provider_of`].
//!
//! # The two boundaries
//!
//! Output, fixed in `src/fact.rs`: a provider states what its records contain,
//! the core decides what it means when nothing was recorded. Input, fixed here
//! (see `docs/DISCOVERY.md`), one level up:
//!
//! > A provider states what a file is. The core decides what a session is.
//!
//! A provider answers questions about single paths in its own layout
//! ([`SessionFile`]); [`assemble`] builds sessions out of the answers, and
//! [`open`] and [`sweep`] are written once over that. A provider never
//! assembles a session, resolves an id, diffs a rescan, or tails.
//!
//! # Adding a provider
//!
//! A provider is one directory, `provider/<name>/`, with three halves:
//!
//! - `wire.rs` — the serde model for the format's records. Defensive: unknown
//!   record types, missing fields and malformed lines parse to something
//!   skippable, never a panic.
//! - `discovery.rs` — where the format keeps a session on disk and how to tell
//!   what a file is. Pure path logic, directory scans, and at most a head read.
//! - `mod.rs` — the provider: a per-file stream whose `push(line)` yields a
//!   [`Statement`] (the record's own time plus the facts it stated).
//!
//! Then one arm in each `match` below: the compiler lists every site. Its
//! fixtures live in `assets/<name>/`, shaped like the real thing so `discovery`
//! finds them the way it finds a live session. Its conformance test is one
//! call, `harness::conform(name, fixture, streams)`, which checks three things:
//! the model reaches the same state however the files interleave (§1.1), the
//! folded model matches `assets/<name>/<fixture>.model.txt`, and the dated
//! timeline matches `assets/<name>/<fixture>.timeline.txt`. The two goldens are
//! generated with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` and are the human-readable record of what
//! the provider extracts. Nothing above `provider/` changes when one is added.
//!
//! A provider's own shape follows its format: the Claude stream carries one
//! inherited timestamp, the Codex stream learns whose file it is from the
//! first line. Both are expected, not deviations.
//!
//! This contract covers agents that write one append-only file per thread.
//! An agent that rewrites a document per turn would add a document push
//! beside `Stream::push`; one that keeps a database is a different kind of
//! feeder, not a wider `SessionFile`.
